## Background 
Jisc provides services and supports the Further Education (FE) and Higher Education (HE) sector. Often, these institutions come to us with problems, and we try to solve them. The following is an example project which we'd like you to complete.

University administrators send lots of emails. They want to shorten the long links to be less offputting to students:

> https://example.com/this-is-an-example-of-a-really-long-link-that-may-look-bad/i-wish-i-could-shorten-this

to

> https://jisc.ac.uk/H7DXS2

## Important information

-   We want the short URL to be as small as technically possible. The university will send 5 emails per week, with 5 links in each email.
-   When the short link is clicked, it should redirect me to the long link.
-   The short link should **always** link to the same long link.

## What we need from you

- Using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) create a UI and an API. You can use whichever database you want to store the data.

- If you have never done frontend work, don't worry, just have a go at the API and have a think about what the UI may look like.

- If you have never done backend work (or aren't as familiar with it), create a frontend in React, using [Material UI (MUI)](https://material-ui.com/) and have a think about what you would expect the API to do.

- We would recommend you don't spend more than 2-4 hours on this project, and if you don't finish it, don't worry. We understand that 2 hours work is not going to produce a piece of art.

- In the interview we will ask you what you would have done differently if you had a day, or a week. How would you look to deploy or host? Would you address certain bottlenecks?

- If you get stuck, or have any questions feel free to email me: Josh.Ring@jisc.ac.uk.

- Once completed, please upload to a public repo on Github.
